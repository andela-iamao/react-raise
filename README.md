react-raise takes away the stress of setting up a react project by bootstraping files and directories you need to get started.

react-raise,
- Initializes your project with es6
- Creates a package.json file and installs all required dependencies
- Creates a webpack file and configures it to:
    - Transpile and compile es6 to es5
    - Compile .js/.jsx
    - Compile .scss/.css
    - Compile .less
- Configures your app such that you are able to use the @ decorators and spread operators
- Set up your react app with the redux architecture
- Uses react-router to setup your app routing
- Configures your test environment

So basically, you can get up an running on your react project in about 10 seconds.
